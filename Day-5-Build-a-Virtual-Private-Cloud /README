# Day 4 – Get Hands-On with Cloud Networking! 🌐

Welcome to Day 4 of my Cloud Engineering journey — today marks the beginning of networking in the cloud. This was a foundational step in understanding how secure, scalable environments are built on AWS.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project focused on **AWS networking basics** — the invisible architecture that supports everything we build in the cloud. I gained clarity on:

- **What a VPC is**, and why it's core to cloud infrastructure
- **The role of public vs private subnets**
- How **routing tables** and **Internet Gateways** control traffic flow
- Security boundaries using **NACLs** and **Security Groups**

---

## ⚙️ What I Built

This was a no-code project, but essential in visualizing how cloud networks operate.

- Explored the **default VPC** and its components
- Understood **IP ranges**, **subnet masks**, and **CIDR blocks**
- Broke down **NAT Gateways** and how they enable outbound internet access from private subnets
- Used **AWS Console diagrams** to understand traffic flow and boundaries

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **AWS Console**
- **VPC Dashboard**
- **AWS Docs & NextWork guide**

---

## 📌 Reflections

Even without deploying resources, this project was a key mental shift — understanding the “why” behind cloud security and traffic architecture. Knowing how cloud networks work is like understanding the plumbing before building the house.
