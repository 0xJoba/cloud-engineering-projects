# üìä Day 17: Connect a Web App with Amazon Aurora
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

When companies need **fast, scalable, and secure relational databases** powering their web apps, Amazon Aurora offers a rock-solid solution.  
Today, I worked on connecting a web application to Aurora and building an end-to-end cloud pipeline.

## üîç The Challenge
- Enable a **web application** to interact securely with a relational database  
- Ensure **scalability and high availability** for production-like scenarios  
- Maintain **secure credentials and connections** between EC2 and Aurora

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Provision Amazon Aurora MySQL**
   - Deployed a scalable and cost-efficient Aurora cluster  
   - Configured backup, monitoring, and security options  

2. **Launch EC2 Instance**
   - Set up an instance to host the web application  
   - Selected an instance type suitable for lightweight app testing  

3. **Deploy Web Application**
   - Built a basic web app to interface with the Aurora backend  
   - Configured environment variables for database credentials  

4. **Connect Web App to Aurora**
   - Used Aurora endpoint and MySQL credentials to establish a secure connection  
   - Verified connectivity via the web app interface and MySQL CLI  

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Ensured that data flow worked correctly  
   - Tested CRUD operations from the web app to the database

## ‚úÖ Outcome
- A **fully functional web app** connected to a relational database in AWS  
- Secure, scalable architecture ready for real-world scenarios  
- Demonstrated the **integration of EC2-hosted applications with Aurora**  

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Amazon Aurora MySQL**  
- **Amazon EC2**  
- **MySQL CLI / Workbench**  
- **Basic Web App Framework (Node.js / Python / PHP, etc.)**
