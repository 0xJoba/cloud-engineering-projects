# 📊 Day 1: Visualize Data with Amazon QuickSight  
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

Today, I explored how to transform raw data into meaningful visuals using **Amazon QuickSight** — fully cloud-native, fast, and insightful.

Coming from a Power BI background, I’ve built dashboards before. But this was about learning how visualization works **natively in the AWS ecosystem**.

## 🔧 What I Did
- 📁 Uploaded the Netflix dataset and `manifest.json` to Amazon S3  
- 🔗 Connected the S3 bucket to QuickSight via manifest structure  
- 📊 Explored insights by release year, content type, and genres  
- 🎯 Filtered for titles like TV Comedies, Action, Thrillers  
- 🧼 Customized chart titles and exported the final dashboard as a clean PDF  
- 🔄 Refreshed the dataset to fix missing country values

## ⚠️ Challenge
Connecting S3 to QuickSight with the `manifest.json` took some trial and error. Once I understood how QuickSight ingests S3 data, it clicked.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Amazon S3  
- Amazon QuickSight  
- JSON (manifest file)  
- Netflix dataset
