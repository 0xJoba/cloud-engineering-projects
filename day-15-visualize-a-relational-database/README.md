  # 📊 Day 17: Solving Data Visibility for Better Decision-Making
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

In today’s data-driven world, organizations can’t afford to guess — they need **clarity, speed, and secure access** to insights.  
For this challenge, I built a secure, AWS-native pipeline to centralize, store, and visualize business data.

---

## 🔍 The Challenge
A simulated company needed to:
- Centralize data from multiple sources
- Store it in a **relational database**
- Provide **real-time dashboards** for stakeholders
- Maintain strict **data security** and cloud efficiency

---

## 🛠️ The Solution
1. **Provisioned Amazon RDS (MySQL)**  
   - Created a MySQL instance inside a secure VPC  
   - Configured automated backups for high availability  

2. **Designed Database Schemas in MySQL Workbench**  
   - Normalized tables for better data integrity  
   - Created indexes for optimized queries  

3. **Imported & Prepared Data**  
   - Loaded CSV datasets into MySQL using Workbench import tools  
   - Verified relationships and query performance  

4. **Configured Security Groups**  
   - Allowed inbound access from QuickSight only  
   - Denied all public internet access to RDS  

5. **Connected Amazon QuickSight to RDS**  
   - Created dynamic dashboards for key metrics  
   - Enabled non-technical users to filter and drill down  

6. **Cleaned Up Resources**  
   - Deleted unused instances  
   - Removed associated security group rules to cut costs

## 🔐 The Result
✅ A secure, **cloud-based end-to-end pipeline** for:
- Data storage
- Transformation
- Visualization  

All built using **AWS-native services** — scalable, cost-optimized, and secure.
