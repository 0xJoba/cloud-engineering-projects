 # ☁️ Cloud Engineering Projects – Powered by Practice

Hi, I’m [Joba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvoice/) — a Cloud Engineering enthusiast actively learning and building infrastructure, one day at a time.

This repository documents my **hands-on journey** through cloud computing, with a focus on solving real-world infrastructure problems using **AWS** and other cloud-native tools. It follows the [NextWork Cloud Engineer roadmap](https://www.nextwork.org/roadmaps/cloud-engineer), but also includes lessons from other industry resources.

Each folder contains:
- A specific project challenge
- What I built
- Why it matters in real-world environments
- Documentation links for deeper insight

## 💡 Why This Matters

Companies don’t just need people who know AWS services — they need people who can use them **to build secure, scalable, production-grade systems**. That’s what I’m practicing here — one challenge at a time.
