  # ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Engineering Projects ‚Äì Powered by Practice

Hi, I‚Äôm **Joba** ‚Äî a Cloud Engineering enthusiast actively building real-world infrastructure, one project at a time.  

This repository documents my hands-on journey through **cloud computing**, focusing on solving practical infrastructure challenges using **AWS** and other cloud-native tools. It follows the **NextWork Cloud Engineer roadmap** while integrating lessons from industry best practices.

## üöÄ What You‚Äôll Find Here
Each folder contains:
- A **specific project challenge**
- **What I built** and why it matters in real-world environments
- Documentation and resources for deeper learning
- Step-by-step examples that you can replicate in your own cloud environment
