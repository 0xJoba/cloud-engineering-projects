# ☁️ Cloud Engineering Projects – Journey with AWS

Welcome to my cloud engineering portfolio — a practical log of my learning journey as I explore AWS and cloud infrastructure, one project at a time.

📍 Guided by the [NextWork Cloud Engineering Roadmap], I'm working through real-world projects that demonstrate my ability to build, secure, and manage cloud-native infrastructure using modern tools and services.

Along the way, I’ll also explore other trusted resources to deepen my expertise and apply what I learn in new ways.

---

## 🚀 My Goals

- Understand how core AWS services work in practice — not just theory
- Learn how to architect, secure, and automate cloud infrastructure
- Build a project portfolio that demonstrates my job readiness
- Contribute to open-source and collaborate with other cloud engineers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I'm Using

Throughout this journey, I’ll be working with a wide range of AWS tools and open-source technologies:

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Amazon S3** (hosting static websites, storing datasets)
- **Amazon EC2** (hosting apps and running secure compute environments)
- **Amazon VPC** (custom networking, peering, and flow logging)
- **Amazon RDS / Aurora (MySQL)** (relational database management)
- **Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL database and querying at scale)
- **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN and secure content delivery)

### 🔐 Security & Identity
- **AWS IAM** (identity, policies, and access control)
- **AWS KMS** (encryption)
- **Secrets Manager**
- **GuardDuty** (threat detection)

### 📊 Data & Visualization
- **Amazon QuickSight** (dashboards and visual analytics)

### ⚙️ Automation & DevOps
- **AWS CLI** & **CloudShell**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **AWS CodeBuild / CodeDeploy**
- **Terraform**
- **AWS CDK**
- **CloudFormation**

### 🤖 AI & Serverless (Coming Soon)
- **Amazon Lex**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Lambda** + **API Gateway**
