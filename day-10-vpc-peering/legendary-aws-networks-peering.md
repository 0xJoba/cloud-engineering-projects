## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon VPC?

Amazon VPC is AWS's foundational networking service that lets us create our own  networks ,control traffic flow and security and orginise our resources into public and private subnets

### How I used Amazon VPC in this project

I used Amazon VPC to set up a multi-VPC Architecture (I set up two VPCs), I also used it to create a peering connection and to update security groups rules to run a succesfull connectivity test to validate my peering set up

### One thing I didn't expect in this project was...

 I didn't expect to need a public IPv4 Address for EC2 instance to work and also didn't expect  that Elastic IPs can assign static IPv4 to resources .

### This project took me...

This project took me about 2hours + including studiing time

---

## In the first part of my project...

### Step 1 - Set up my VPC

 In this step i will be using VPC resources/map wizard to create two VPCs and their components in just minutes

### Step 2 - Create a Peering Connection

In this step , I will be setting up a VPC Peering connections, which is a VPC Component designed to directly connect two VPCs together

### Step 3 - Update Route Tables

In this project , i will be setting up a way for traffic coming from VPC 1 to get to VPC 2 and for traffic coming from VPC 2 to get to VPC 1

### Step 4 - Launch EC2 Instances

In this step - I will be Launching an EC2 instance in each VPC (VPC 1 and VPC 2), so that i can connect them directly to my instance and use them to test my VPC peering connection later.

---

## Multi-VPC Architecture

I started my project by launching two VPCs - They have unique CIDR Blocks and 1 Subnet

The CIDR blocks for VPCs 1 and 2 are "10.1.0.0/16" and " 10.2.0.0/16" respectively - They have unique IPv4 CIDR block so the IP addresses of their resources don't overlap. Having overlapping IP addresses could cause routing conflicts and connectivity issues!

### I also launched 2 EC2 instances

I didn't set up key pairs for these EC2 instances because i am using EC2 instance connect to connect directly with the EC2 Instance in this project (AWS handles Key Pair Creation and mangement for me)

## VPC Peering

A VPC peering connection is a direct connection between two VPCs - A peering connection lets VPCs and their resources route traffic between them using their private IP addresses. This means data can now be transferred between VPCs without going through the public internet.

Without a peering connection, data transfers between VPCs would use resources' public address - meaning VPCs have to communicate over the public internet.

VPCs would use peering connections to lets VPCs and their resources route traffic between them using their private IP addresses. This means data can now be transferred between VPCs without going through the public internet.

The difference between a Requester and an Accepter in a peering connection is that the Requester initiates a peering connection - The requester will send the other VPC an invitation to connect! While,the Accepter is the VPC that receives a peering connection request! The Accepter can either accept or decline the invitation. 

For this project - The Requester VPC was "NextWork-1-vpc" and the Accepter VPC was Accepter VPC  "NextWork-2-vpc"

Because peering connection isn't actually made until the other VPC also agrees to it i also accepted the connection to establishing the VPC peering

## Updating route tables

After accepting a peering connection, my VPCs' route tables need to be updated because the default route table doesn't have a route using the peering connection yet - This needs to be set up so that resources can be  directed to the peering connection when trying to reach other VPC. 

My VPCs' new routes have a destination of the other VPCs CIDR block . The routes' target was  the pairng connection i set up

## In the second part of my project...

### Step 5 - Use EC2 Instance Connect

In this step ,I will be testing my VPC peering connection - I will need one of my EC2 instances to try talk to the other. Hence, I will use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to my EC2 instance.

### Step 6 - Connect to EC2 Instance 1

In this step , I will be re-attempting my connecting to my EC2 instance and reolving another error preventing me from using EC2 instance connect to connect directly to the instance

### Step 7 - Test VPC Peering

In this step, I will be using the instance "NextWork VPC-1" to attempt a direct connection with Instance "NextWork VPC-2" so that i can validate that my peering connection is set up properly

---

## Troubleshooting Instance Connect

Next, I used EC2 Instance Connect to directly connect with my first EC2 instance " Instance - NextWork VPC 1." just by using the AWS Management Console

'I was stopped from using EC2 Instance Connect as my instance did not have a IPV4 address. In order for EC2 Instance to work  the Ec2 instance must have a public IPv4 address and be in a public subnet

## Elastic IP addresses

To resolve this error, I set up Elastic IP addresses. Elastic IP addresses are static IPv4 addresses that get allocated to your AWS account, and is yours to delegate to an EC2 instance - "Static" would mean that because EC2 instances by default have dynamic IPs,   their Public IPv4 addresses change every time they're restarted.Having an Elastic IP is like having a permanent address in a city, instead of having to move from location to location every time your instance restarts.

Associating an Elastic IP address resolved the error because it gives my EC2 Instance a Public IP address fulfilling all the requirements for my EC2 instance to work

## Troubleshooting ping issues

To test VPC peering, I ran the command "ping 10.x.xx.xxx"
(Which is the "NextWork VPC 2'sÂ Private IPv4 address ") 

A successful ping test would validate my VPC peering connection - this ping test will not get ANY replies from other EC2 Instance if the connection did not connect the   two VPCs. Hence, getting ping replies = connection was set up properly .

I had to update my second EC2 instance's security group because it was not letting in ICMP traffic- which is a traffic type of a ping message. I added a new rule that allows ICMP traffic coming in from any resource in VPC 2.
