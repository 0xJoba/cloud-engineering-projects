# 📊 Day 19: Query Data with DynamoDB
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

How do you get **meaningful insights** from a DynamoDB table?  
Unlike SQL in relational databases, DynamoDB has a different approach to data retrieval — optimized for speed and scalability.

---

## 🔍 The Challenge
- Retrieve specific items efficiently from a **NoSQL table**  
- Understand how **partition and sort keys** structure queries  
- Work with DynamoDB using both **CLI and AWS Console**  

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Set Up DynamoDB Table**
   - Created table with appropriate partition and sort keys  
   - Loaded sample data using AWS CloudShell  

2. **Query with Partition and Sort Keys**
   - Structured queries to target specific items efficiently  
   - Leveraged `query` and `scan` operations appropriately  

3. **Test Queries**
   - Used AWS Console to validate table structure and results  
   - Ran CLI commands to confirm correct retrieval and low-latency responses  

4. **Analyze Trade-offs**
   - Noted that DynamoDB sacrifices some flexibility compared to SQL  
   - Gained insight into when speed and scalability outweigh relational flexibility  

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Successfully queried a **NoSQL table** using both CLI and AWS Console  
- Learned how to optimize queries with **partition and sort keys**  
- Developed practical understanding of **DynamoDB’s speed and scalability advantages**
