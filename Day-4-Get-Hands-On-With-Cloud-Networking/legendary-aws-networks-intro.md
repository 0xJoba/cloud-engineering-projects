## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

Starting my networking journey â€” one project at a time.
Right now, some of the terms feels new and a little intimidating (hello, subnets ðŸ‘€), but Iâ€™m here to learn how cloud systems actually connect and talk to each other.

Iâ€™ll probably break a few things,Google 100+ errors, and get lost in CIDR blocks. And thatâ€™s okay.

I'm In ! 9 projects in this series 

Businesses traditionally had to build and manage their own physical networks â€” buying hardware, running cables, maintaining data centers, and hiring IT teams to keep everything running.

Cloud networking changed things by making all of that virtual. Now companies can use cloud providers like AWS to create and manage networks through software â€” without owning any hardware â€” and only pay for what they use.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 3 focused hours every week to work through this networking series â€” even if the IP addresses start to look like hieroglyphics.

I will keep myself accountable by tracking my progress in public, sharing what I learn, and showing up even when it gets tough.

My reward is a deeper understanding of how the cloud really works, a stronger portfolio â€” and maybe a big bowl of jollof rice or something like enjoying a food craving when I finish.haha

### What are networks?

A computer network is a system that connects two or more devices so they can communicate and share data. This could be as simple as connecting two laptops in a room, or as complex as the global internet.

In cloud computing, networks are the invisible highways that move information between servers, apps, and users. They control how systems "talk" to each other, how data travels, and how everything stays connected â€” securely and efficiently.

Learning networking is key to understanding how the cloud works behind the scenes.
And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here â€” to figure it out, one project at a time...

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your own private section of the cloud where you can launch AWS resources â€” like servers, databases, or web apps â€” in a controlled and secure environment.Itâ€™s like carving out your own gated neighborhood inside AWS, where you control who gets in, how data moves, and what connects to what.
This helps organizations by giving them control over networking, security, and traffic flow in the cloud.
