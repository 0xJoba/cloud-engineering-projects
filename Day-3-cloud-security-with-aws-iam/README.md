# 🔐 Day 3: Cloud Security with AWS IAM  
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

Today was all about **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** — the foundation of AWS security. I focused on controlling who can access what, and under what conditions.

## ✅ What I Did
- 💻 Launched and managed EC2 instances  
- 👤 Created IAM **users**, **groups**, and **custom policies**  
- 🧪 Used the **IAM Policy Simulator** to test permissions before applying them  
- 🧭 Explored practical scenarios like:
  - Automating least-privilege access  
  - Setting a custom sign-in URL using an **account alias**

## 🏅 Bonus Task
Via the **AWS CLI**, I tagged EC2 instances and enforced access control:  
> Only IAM users with matching resource tags could take action on specific EC2 instances.

## ⚠️ Challenge
Balancing flexibility and strict control in custom IAM policies was eye-opening. The simulator helped catch mistakes before deployment.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AWS IAM  
- AWS EC2  
- IAM Policy Simulator  
- AWS CLI  
- IAM JSON Policy Language

📌 Security is the backbone of cloud architecture. IAM gave me hands-on experience in building it from the ground up.
