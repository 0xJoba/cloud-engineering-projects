# 🚀 Starting the AWS Databases Phase

After completing the **Networking phase**, I’m moving into one of the most critical pillars of cloud engineering — **databases**.

Every modern application relies on storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently. In the cloud, this means working with **scalable, highly available, and secure database services**. That’s where AWS shines — and that’s what I’m here to master.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this phase is to:
- **Design and deploy** real-world database solutions with **Amazon RDS**, **Aurora**, and **DynamoDB**
- Understand both **relational** and **NoSQL** database models
- **Integrate databases** with web applications and data visualization tools like **Amazon QuickSight**
- Document every project in **clear, portfolio-ready** formats

---

## 🛠 Problem to Solve
Modern applications demand:
1. **High availability** — downtime costs money.
2. **Scalability** — traffic spikes shouldn’t crash the system.
3. **Data integrity & security** — sensitive data must be protected.
4. **Performance optimization** — queries should be fast and cost-effective.

This phase focuses on solving these problems by using **AWS-managed database services** that reduce operational overhead while improving reliability.

---

## ✅ Approach
- Deploy **Aurora MySQL** in a secure VPC and connect it to an EC2 instance
- Load and query data in **DynamoDB** for ultra-fast NoSQL performance
- Benchmark differences between relational and non-relational approaches
- Integrate datasets with **QuickSight** for visual analytics
- Troubleshoot networking, security group, and connection issues like a production environment

---

## 💡 Mindset
This won’t be a copy-paste tutorial. There will be:
- Console errors that require debugging
- Configuration issues that need creative solutions
- Architectural decisions that impact scalability and security

But that’s the point — **problem-solving is the skill employers value most**.

## 📍 Next Steps
Up next: **Visualizing my first relational database directly in QuickSight** — turning raw tables into actionable insights.
