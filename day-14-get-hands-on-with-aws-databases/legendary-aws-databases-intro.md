## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I'm learning about how to build, connect, and manage both relational and NoSQL databases using key AWS services like RDS, Aurora, and DynamoDB.

By the end of these projects, I will have hands-on experience setting up real-world database solutions, querying data for insights, and securely connecting databases to applications and analytics tools like QuickSight.

I'm learning about cloud databases because they are a foundational part of modern applications, and gaining these skills prepares me for roles in cloud engineering, DevOps, and data-driven product development.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

I will set aside 3‚Äì4 focused hours each day to dive into these AWS database projects, treating them like real-world client tasks to sharpen my hands-on skills.

To stay consistent and accountable, I‚Äôll be sharing my progress publicly on LinkedIn and keeping track through my NextWork documentation. Each update is a reminder of how far I‚Äôve come‚Äîand how close I am to mastery.

My reward for completing this AWS Databases series? A stronger cloud portfolio, more confidence around data-driven architecture... and definitely a plate of spicy chicken. üçóüî• Because every cloud engineer deserves a proper celebration!

### What are databases?

Databases are structured digital systems designed to store, manage, and retrieve large volumes of information efficiently. They centralize and organize data‚Äîsuch as customer profiles, transactions, inventory, and user activity‚Äîso that it's accessible, consistent, and secure across an organization.

Cloud engineers use databases to support applications that rely on real-time data, ensure high availability and performance, and maintain data integrity across distributed systems. In cloud environments like AWS, they also configure scalability, backups, and secure access to these databases, making them a critical backbone for modern applications and services.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals are responsible for designing, setting up, securing, and managing databases that store and serve business-critical data. Their role includes tasks like configuring cloud database services, modeling data structures, writing SQL queries, monitoring performance, and ensuring secure, reliable access to data for applications and analytics tools.

The most interesting part of their job is turning raw data into powerful insights‚Äîby connecting databases to real-time applications, dashboards, and services that drive decision-making. In cloud environments like AWS, database professionals also benefit from automation and scalability, allowing them to focus more on innovation and less on infrastructure maintenance.
