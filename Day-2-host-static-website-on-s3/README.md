# 🌐 Day 2: Host a Static Website on Amazon S3  
**NextWork Cloud Engineering Journey**

Today’s hands-on project walked me through deploying a real, working static website using **Amazon S3** — one of the most cost-effective and scalable ways to host content on the web.

## ✅ What I Did
- 🪣 Created an S3 bucket and enabled **static website hosting**
- 📁 Uploaded an `index.html` file and a simple `error.html` page  
- ⚙️ Set the **bucket policy** to make the site publicly accessible  
- 🌍 Got a working S3 website URL and tested it in the browser  
- 🛑 Handled 404 errors using the custom error page

## ⚠️ Challenge
Writing the right bucket policy for public access was a bit tricky. I had to ensure I wasn’t opening the whole bucket up recklessly while still allowing web traffic.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AWS S3  
- Static HTML files (`index.html`, `error.html`)  
- Bucket policy configuration

📌 Learning how to deliver content directly through the cloud is powerful — and gives a better sense of how modern websites scale.
