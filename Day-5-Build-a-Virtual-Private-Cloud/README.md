# Day 5 – Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 🌐🏗️

Today, I got hands-on with building a custom Virtual Private Cloud from scratch — a major milestone in my AWS Cloud Engineering journey.

Unlike the default VPC, this project helped me understand how to set up and control my own network environment inside AWS.

---

## 🔨 What I Built

✅ Created a new **VPC** with a custom CIDR block  
✅ Added **subnets** across two Availability Zones  
✅ Set up an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** and attached it to the VPC  
✅ Configured a **Route Table** for internet access  
✅ Launched a **test EC2 instance** in the public subnet to verify connectivity  
✅ Used **NACLs and Security Groups** to manage network security

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How VPC components interact to control traffic
- The difference between **Security Groups** (stateful) vs **NACLs** (stateless)
- How to isolate infrastructure using subnets
- How to troubleshoot connectivity issues in new network environments

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **AWS Console**
- **VPC Dashboard**
- **EC2**
- **Security Groups & NACLs**
- **NextWork Docs**

 

This wasn’t just about clicking through — it was about *designing cloud networks* the way enterprise-grade systems do. Learning in public, one block at a time.
